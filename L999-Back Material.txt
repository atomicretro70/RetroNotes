Every logic described is organized into the following sections:

   Language
   Semantics
      ...
      Translation Hints
   Calculus  (Inferences)
   Philosophical Concerns
   Proofs

Inference Rules Notation

   P(Q)   but, P(c) denotes predicate
   P[Q]   but, [...] denotes optional things but 
   P{Q}   but, {...} denotes sets
   P<Q>   but, <...> denotes tuples

   P(Q) indicates that a wff P contains one or more occurrences of
   sub-expression Q.

   P(R/Q) indicates the result of replacing one or more occurrences
   of Q in P with R.  R/Q is read, "R replaced one or more occurrences of Q".

   P(R//Q) like above but indicates replacing all occurrences of Q in P with
   R.  R//Q is read, "R replaced all occurrences of Q"

   P(c),P(a/c),P(a//c), similar to the above but a and c are object symbols.

   [ ... ] indicates that the enclosed must exist, be defined or proven
   elsewhere.

Document Conventions
--------------------

Do's and Don'ts

   TABS ARE THE ENEMY - SPACES ONLY!

   White space is our friend.  Don't squish stuff together Everything looks
   better with more whitespace than is technically necessary (but please,
   not *too* much).

   Avoid stacking - when the same symbols appear in two separate lines
   one below the other.

   Avoid splitting hyphenated words when one of the two words is very short
   (like 2 or 3 letters).  (Try very to not split words between lines)

   Avoid ending a paragraph or column of text with a line containing only
   a few words.

   Avoid too long a sequence of lines that grow progressively longer or
   progressively shorter.  Ideally the left column should have a nice wavy
   look.  (This may be difficult in mono-spaced font).

   Avoid having a string of one or more small words at the end of a line;
   especially following a period.

   All headers will be preceded by a blank line.

   Over/Underline headers are preceded by two blank lines.

   Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 headers will be left justified.  Other headers are
   indented 3 spaces for each level.

   Indentation of tables and diagrams will be more liberal to accomodate the
   limited page width.

   I really like this very simple clean level 1 header below


Document Text

   I'll try to use shorter words when I think of it and it seems to me to not
   degrade clarity.  Again to conserve space.

   I'll try to keep personal commentary minimal

Diagrams & Tables

   I'll do my best to align diagrams and tables when they appear close
   together, but width limitations (and mono-spacing) can make that difficult.

   For text don't cr unless necessary; try to get close to column 78.  There
   may be oddball cases where it looks like a word is straggling new column
   78 but the nearby text is quite shorter.  In this case I'll CR early to
   avoid that orphan or dangler.

ALL CAPS

   Used to make important pieces to text stand out, mostly used for a term
   when it's defined (to make it easier to search for the definition).

Italics

   When some text is italicized it will be surrounded *like this*.

Use, Mention and Quotes

   It's useful to differentiate between whether something's meaning is part
   of a sentence structure, of whether something is just being mentioned.

   SINGLE QUOTES are used When we wish to merely MENTIONING something.

      The sentence 'Alice loves Bob,' is transitive.

   NO QUOTES are used if something is used as part of the sentence.

      Alice loves Bob, but Bob doesn't love Alice.

   To indicate something that someone actually said, we use DOUBLE QUOTES.

      Alice said, "I love Bob."

   Notice double quotes, like single, describe something that's mentioned.
   The key difference being that double quotes surround verbatim sentences.

   @@@ I'm sort of lax about using single quote for mentions, and often
   don't.  I may or may not correct this in future revisions.

Annotations to myself

   I will precede any editing annotations to myself with @@@.
   (These should never be visible in a release version - if I don't mess up).

Notation Regarding SYMBOLOGY

   The particular set of symbols chosen in this text may not be to everyone's
   taste.  However, this symbology was chosen on several aesthetic principles
   that I believe are analogous to their denotations.  My chosen set of
   logical operation symbols forms a set of symmetric symbols consisting
   entirely of straight *well-defined* lines - just as the discrete primitive
   principles they denote. Symbols remain that can be flipped and rotated but
   my two favorite are <- and >-.  Because I like to think most
   would agree that these symbols clearly symmetrically denote 'provided' and
   'strictly provided'; Or (P -> Q) written backwards (Q <- P), and
   □(-P -> -Q), and so are easily defined, perhaps as toys, from our
   traditional symbology.  

   Compare that to the large rounded (P,Q,R,S) letters denoting things less
   easily defined.  No doubt at this point one might be wondering of the
   parentheses.  Surely all of this implies I ought to have chosen brackets?
   But the beauty in choosing these vertical arcs is that they denote circles;
   sometimes you can even see two-dimensional bubble around its contents, (x).
   All such that our formulas are in perfectly nested recursive bubbles that
   pop one-by-one from the outside in, or form the inside out as we manipulate
   or evaluate expressions.

   So the chosen symbol set is round and curvy just where it needs to be, and
   rigidly defined straight line symmetries to denote similarly rigidly
   defined definitions and operations.  And just in between those we have the
   symmetrical arcs of the parenthesis denoting two-dimensional bubbles.

Notation Regarding Venn Diagrams

   Obviously circles aren't possible.  I did consider diamonds using / and \,
   but they would have been larger causing the diagrams to take up more space.
   I wanted the diagrams to be more compact and they are as compact as they
   can get with my chosen set of marks.  I think any smaller and it would
   become too difficult to read them.  Upon first glace the rectangles may
   seem harder to read than circles, but I found I adjusted quickly.  For
   those disappointed in my choice, cocking your head to the right makes the
   rectangles look more similar to conventional Venn diagrams.  If you read
   this with the same editor and font that I'm using, the rectangles look
   nearly square.
