Scientists discover the measurable contours and shapes of a physical
reality, *the natural*.  But that path doesn't possess complete explanatory
power.  The sceniences themselves are beautiful, but will always discover
the mechanical (discrete, deterministic), but never explaining infinitude mind .
Is the universe that and nothing more than what can be measured?ZZZZZZ

   Philosophical Concerns
   Proofs

Inference Rules Notation

   A capital Greek letter (Φ, Ψ, Θ, Δ, etc.) denotes any arbitrary formula,
   and a lower case Greek letter (α, β, δ, etc.) denotes any arbitrary
   object symbol.

   Φ(Ψ) indicates that a wff Φ contains one or more occurrences of
   sub-wff Ψ.

   Φ(Θ/Ψ) indicates the result of replacing one or more occurrences
   of Ψ in Ψ with Θ.  Θ/Ψ is read, "Θ replaced one or more occurrences of Ψ".

   Φ (Θ//Ψ) like above but indicates replacing all occurrences of Ψ in Φ with
   Θ.  Θ//Ψ is read, "Θ replaced all occurrences of Ψ"

   Φ(β),Φ(α/β),Φ(α//β), similar to the above but α and β are object symbols.

   [ ... ] indicates that the enclosed must exist, be defined or proven
   elsewhere.

Document Conventions
--------------------

Do's and Don'ts

   TABS ARE THE ENEMY - SPACES ONLY!

   White space is our friend.  Don't squish stuff together Everything looks
   better with more whitespace than is technically necessary (but please,
   not *too* much).

   Avoid stacking - when the same symbols appear in two separate lines
   one below the other.

   Avoid splitting hyphenated words when one of the two words is very short
   (like 2 or 3 letters).  (Try very to not split words between lines)

   Avoid ending a paragraph or column of text with a line containing only
   a few words.

   Avoid too long a sequence of lines that grow progressively longer or
   progressively shorter.  Ideally the left column should have a nice wavy
   look.  (This may be difficult in mono-spaced font).

   Avoid having a string of one or more small words at the end of a line;
   especially following a period.

   Try to use shorter words when I think of it and it seems to me to not
   degrade clarity.  Again to conserve space.

   Try to keep personal commentary minimal

typography

   *text*  Asterisks denote italics

   @@@text denotes any editing annotations to myself.  (These should never
           be visible in a release version - if I don't mess up).

   TEXT  makes important pieces of text stand out, mostly used for a term
           when it's defined (to make it easier to search for the definition).

Use, Mention and Quotes

   It's useful to differentiate between whether something's meaning is part
   of a sentence structure, of whether something is just being mentioned.

   SINGLE QUOTES are used When we wish to merely MENTIONING something.

      The sentence 'Alice loves Bob,' is transitive.

   NO QUOTES are used if something is used as part of the sentence.

      Alice loves Bob, but Bob doesn't love Alice.

   To indicate something that someone actually said, we use DOUBLE QUOTES.

      Alice said, "I love Bob."

   Notice double quotes, like single, describe something that's mentioned.
   The key difference being that double quotes surround verbatim sentences.

First Text Column

   Headers of levels 1,2,3,4 begin in column 1.

   Level 5 headers begin in column 4, and are short.

   All body text begins in column 4.  If a level 5 header is a term, the
   subordinate body text begins in column 7.

   Examples and all other kinds of text begin in column 10.

   Tables and diagrams will begin in column 10 provided everything can fit
   on the line, otherwise they'll begin in column 4.
   
Headers

   All headers will be surrounded blank lines.  Level 1 & 2 headers
   are preceded by two blank lines.

Diagrams & Tables

   I'll do my best to align diagrams and tables when they appear close
   together, but width limitations (and mono-spacing) can make that difficult.

   For text don't cr unless necessary; try to get close to column 78.  There
   may be oddball cases where it looks like a word is straggling new column
   78 but the nearby text is quite shorter.  In this case I'll CR early to
   avoid that orphan or dangler.

Notation Regarding SYMBOLOGY

   The notation selected for this book may vary slightly from that of other
   books.  However, the symbol set was selected to reflect aesthetic
   principles.  The logical operator symbols consist of well-defined straight
   lines in symmetrical arrangements to reflect the similarly well-defined
   rigid logical operations.  Parentheses, used for grouping just as in math,
   can be thought of as representing nested bubbles.  Both of these are in
   stark contrast to the large round or curvy letters used to denote more
   complex, less well-defined English sentences.

Notation Regarding Venn Diagrams

   Obviously circles aren't possible.  I did consider diamonds using / and \,
   but they would have been larger causing the diagrams to take up more space.
   I wanted the diagrams to be more compact and they are as compact as they
   can get with my chosen set of marks.  I think any smaller and it would
   become too difficult to read them.  Upon first glace the rectangles may
   seem harder to read than circles, but I found I adjusted quickly.  For
   those disappointed in my choice, cocking your head to the right makes the
   rectangles look more similar to conventional Venn diagrams.  If you read
   this with the same editor and font that I'm using, the rectangles look
   nearly square.

   Procedure

   1.  Write a vertical list of wffs to be tested.  This list forms the root
       of our tree.

   2.  Repeatedly apply the following rules in any order.  The tree is
       only completed when no more rules can be applied.
